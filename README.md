Find out who's hot and who's not in the Pokemon world

Background:

When I was a boy, there was only one Pokemon: Pikachu. Now there are nearly half a million. "Catching 'em all", as the TV show used to say, has become a daunting if not impossible task. That got me thinking: does someone know every Pokemon? Are there any Pokemon that nobody remembers? Is a forgotten Pokemon forever erased from the memory of the universe, or does it continue to exist in some Platonic realm?

With this app, you can see which Pokemon people are talking about on Twitter. It connects to the Pokemon api to return a list of all Pokemon ever, then it connects to the Twitter api to look for all the tweets that contain the selected Pokemon's name.

Tools Used:

- Next JS
- Pokemon API
- Twitter API
